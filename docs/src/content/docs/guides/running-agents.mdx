Agents do nothing by themselves – you **run** them with the `Runner` class or the `run()` utility.

<Code lang="typescript" code={helloWorldExample} title="Simple run" />

When you don't need a custom runner, you can also use the `run()` utility, which runs a singletone default `Runner` instance.

Alternatively, you can create your own runner instance:

<Code lang="typescript" code={helloWorldWithRunnerExample} title="Simple run" />

After running your agent, you will receive a [result](/openai-agents-js/guides/results) object that contains the final output and the full history of the run.

## The agent loop

When you use the run method in Runner, you pass in a starting agent and input. The input can either be a string (which is considered a user message), or a list of input items, which are the items in the OpenAI Responses API.

The runner then runs a loop:

1. Call the current agent’s model with the current input.
2. Inspect the LLM response.
   - **Final output** → return.
   - **Handoff** → switch to the new agent, keep the accumulated conversation history, go to 1.
   - **Tool calls** → execute tools, append their results to the conversation, go to 1.
3. Throw [`MaxTurnsExceededError`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/maxturnsexceedederror) once `maxTurns` is reached.

<Aside type="note">
  The rule for whether the LLM output is considered as a "final output" is that
  it produces text output with the desired type, and there are no tool calls.
</Aside>

### Runner lifecycle

Create a `Runner` when your app starts and reuse it across requests. The instance
stores global configuration such as model provider and tracing options. Only
create another `Runner` if you need a completely different setup. For simple
scripts you can also call `run()` which uses a default runner internally.

## Run arguments

The input to the `run()` method is an initial agent to start the run on, input for the run and a set of options.

The input can either be a string (which is considered a user message), or a list of [input items](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/type-aliases/agentinputitem), or a [`RunState`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/runstate) object in case you are building a [human-in-the-loop](/openai-agents-js/guides/human-in-the-loop) agent.

The additional options are:

| Option     | Default | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stream`   | `false` | If `true` the call returns a `StreamedRunResult` and emits events as they arrive from the model.                                   |
| `context`  | –       | Context object forwarded to every tool / guardrail / handoff. Learn more in the [context guide](/openai-agents-js/guides/context). |
| `maxTurns` | `10`    | Safety limit – throws [`MaxTurnsExceededError`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/maxturnsexceedederror) when reached.  |
| `signal`   | –       | `AbortSignal` for cancellation.                                                                                                    |

## Streaming

Streaming allows you to additionally receive streaming events as the LLM runs. Once the stream is started, the `StreamedRunResult` will contain the complete information about the run, including all the new outputs produces. You can iterate over the streaming events using a `for await` loop. Read more in the [streaming guide](/openai-agents-js/guides/streaming).

## Run config

If you are creating your own `Runner` instance, you can pass in a `RunConfig` object to configure the runner.

| Field                       | Type                  | Purpose                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `model`                     | `string \| Model`     | Force a specific model for **all** agents in the run.                                            |
| `modelProvider`             | `ModelProvider`       | Resolves model names – defaults to the OpenAI provider.                                          |
| `modelSettings`             | `ModelSettings`       | Global tuning parameters that override per‑agent settings.                                       |
| `handoffInputFilter`        | `HandoffInputFilter`  | Mutates input items when performing handoffs (if the handoff itself doesn’t already define one). |
| `inputGuardrails`           | `InputGuardrail[]`    | Guardrails applied to the _initial_ user input.                                                  |
| `outputGuardrails`          | `OutputGuardrail[]`   | Guardrails applied to the _final_ output.                                                        |
| `tracingDisabled`           | `boolean`             | Disable OpenAI Tracing completely.                                                               |
| `traceIncludeSensitiveData` | `boolean`             | Exclude LLM/tool inputs & outputs from traces while still emitting spans.                        |
| `workflowName`              | `string`              | Appears in the Traces dashboard – helps group related runs.                                      |
| `traceId` / `groupId`       | `string`              | Manually specify the trace or group ID instead of letting the SDK generate one.                  |
| `traceMetadata`             | `Record<string, any>` | Arbitrary metadata to attach to every span.                                                      |

## Conversations / chat threads

Each call to `runner.run()` (or `run()` utility) represents one **turn** in your application-level conversation. You
choose how much of the `RunResult` you show the end‑user – sometimes only `finalOutput`, other
times every generated item.

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  code={chatLoopExample}
  title="Example of carrying over the conversation history"
/>

See [the chat example](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js/tree/main/examples/basic/chat.ts) for an interactive version.

## Exceptions

The SDK throws a small set of errors you can catch:

- [`MaxTurnsExceededError`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/maxturnsexceedederror) – `maxTurns` reached.
- [`ModelBehaviorError`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/modelbehaviorerror) – model produced invalid output (e.g. malformed JSON, unknown tool).
- [`InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/inputguardrailtripwiretriggered) / [`OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/outputguardrailtripwiretriggered) – guardrail violations.
- [`GuardrailExecutionError`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/guardrailexecutionerror) – guardrails failed to complete.
- [`ToolCallError`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/toolcallerror) – any of function tool calls failed.
- [`UserError`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/usererror) – any error thrown based on configuration or user input.

All extend the base `AgentsError` class, which could provide the `state` property to access the current run state.

Here is an example code that handles `GuardrailExecutionError`:

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  code={runningAgentsExceptionExample}
  title="Guardrail execution error"
/>

When you run the above example, you will see the following output:

```
Guardrail execution failed: Error: Input guardrail failed to complete: Error: Something is wrong!
Math homework guardrail tripped
```

## Next steps

- Learn how to [configure models](/openai-agents-js/guides/models).
- Provide your agents with [tools](/openai-agents-js/guides/tools).
- Add [guardrails](/openai-agents-js/guides/guardrails) or [tracing](/openai-agents-js/guides/tracing) for production readiness.
