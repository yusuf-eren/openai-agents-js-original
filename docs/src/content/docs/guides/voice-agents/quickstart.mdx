<Steps>

0. **Create a project**

   In this quickstart we will create a voice agent you can use in the browser. If you want to check out a new project, you can try out [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) or [`Vite`](https://vite.dev/guide/installation.html).

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-project --template vanilla-ts
   ```

1. **Install the Agents SDK**

   ```bash
   npm install @openai/agents
   ```

   Alternatively you can install `@openai/agents-realtime` for a standalone browser package.

2. **Generate a client ephemeral token**

   As this application will run in the users browser, we need a secure way to connect to the model through the Realtime API. For this we can use a [ephemeral client key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime#creating-an-ephemeral-token) that should get generated on your backend server. For testing purposes you can also generate a key using `curl` and your regular OpenAI API key.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/sessions \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2025-06-03"
      }'
   ```

   The response will contain a `client_secret.value` value that you can use to connect later on. Note that this key is only valid for a short period of time and will need to be regenerated.

3. **Create your first Agent**

   Creating a new [`RealtimeAgent`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-realtime/classes/realtimeagent/) is very similar to creating a regular [`Agent`](/openai-agents-js/guides/agents).

   ```typescript
   import { RealtimeAgent } from '@openai/agents-realtime';

   const agent = new RealtimeAgent({
     name: 'Assistant',
     instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
   });
   ```

4. **Create a session**

   Unlike a regular agent, a Voice Agent is continously running and listening inside a `RealtimeSession` that handles the conversation and connection to the model over time. This session will also handle the audio processing, interruptions, and a lot of the other lifecycle functionality we will cover later on.

   ```typescript
   import { RealtimeSession } from '@openai/agents-realtime';

   const session = new RealtimeSession(agent, {
     model: 'gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2025-06-03',
   });
   ```

   The `RealtimeSession` constructor takes an `agent` as the first argument. This agent will be the first agent that your user will be able to interact with.

5. **Connect to the session**

   To connect to the session you need to pass the client ephemeral token you generated earlier on.

   ```typescript
   await session.connect({ apiKey: '<client-api-key>' });
   ```

   This will connect to the Realtime API using WebRTC in the browser and automatically configure your microphone and speaker for audio input and output. If you are running your `RealtimeSession` on a backend server (like Node.js) the SDK will automatically use WebSocket as a connection. You can learn more about the different transport layers in the [Realtime Transport Layer](/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents/transport) guide.

6. **Putting it all together**

   <Code lang="typescript" code={helloWorldExample} />

7. **Fire up the engines and start talking**

   Start up your webserver and navigate to the page that includes your new Realtime Agent code. You should see a request for microphone access. Once you grant access you should be able to start talking to your agent.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

</Steps>

## Next Steps

From here you can start designing and building your own voice agent. Voice agents include a lot of the same features as regular agents, but have some of their own unique features.

- Learn how to give your voice agent:

  - [Handoffs](/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents/build#handoffs)
  - [Guardrails](/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents/build#guardrails)
  - [Handle audio interruptions](/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents/build#audio-interruptions)
  - [Manage session history](/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents/build#session-history)

- Learn more about the different transport layers.
